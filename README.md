# Student Grades Calculation

Student Grades Calculation
This project is a simple program written in JavaScript that calculates the grades of a group of students based on their first and second grades. The program takes an array of objects, with each object representing a student and their grades.

Usage
To use this program, simply copy and paste the code into a JavaScript file and run it using Node.js or in the browser console.

The program will loop through each student in the array, calculate their average grade, and then display a message indicating whether they passed or failed the test based on their average grade.
